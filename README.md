👋 Hi, I’m @leandrocontreiras19
👀 I’m interested in learning programming language and expose my projects to the community about modeling, automation and corporate process improvement.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python and I intend to learn other programming language.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code, conversation and projects.
📫 How to reach me leandrocontreiras@hotmail.com or leandrocontreiras@gmail.com.
This is a process automation project for B3's feedback on the SRO layout. It ranges from webscrapping, data wrangling, outlook and excel control, to GUI usage. The running program is in the zip folder shown above for support and understanding.
